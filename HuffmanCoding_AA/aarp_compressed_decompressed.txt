"Work, Family, Future"      Address to the American Association of Retired Persons            Governor Bill Clinton                 Henry Gonzales Convention Center                        San Antonio, Texas            June 4, 1992   Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much PresidentBurgess, ladies and gentlemen. I am so honored to be invited to behere with you today. I appreciate the warm welcome on coming in. It is an amazing thing to be through this long string ofpresidential primaries where I learned a lot about not only howmuch we have in common, but how different we are as Americans. I'malways amazed at each day I learn something about how Americanpeople can look at the same set of facts and draw differentconclusions from it.  And since I am here at the AARP, I thought Iwould tell you a story I heard the other day that illustrates thispoint so well -- about a couple who'd been married just a littleover fifty years.  They were sitting out on their porch rocking intheir chairs, and the husband looked at his wife and he said,"Sarah, you know we've been together a long time."   And she said,"Yes."  And he said, "I'm really a man of few words -- all theseyears there are so many things I should have said to you that Ididn't."   She said, "Yeah."  He said, "You know, we got married inthe depression and you believed in me, but it was the depression.And not long after we got married our little business went down andI was flat broke, but you hung in there with me."   And she said,"Yeah, I did."  He said, "Then I went off to World War II and I gotthat bad wound, and it took me a year to overcome it, but you hungin there with me everyday."  She said, "Yeah, I did."  He said,"Then after the war, we finally moved into our own home for thefirst time and six months later a tornado came along and blew itdown. It took us six years to get in our house again, but you hungin there with me, didn't you."    And she said, "Yes, I did."  Andhe said, "Well, Sarah, before it is too late, I just want to tellyou one thing. Honey, you're bad luck."  So, if you want to beinvolved in this enterprise on which I have embarked, you have tobe willing to have people see facts in a different way than you do.In that connection, I want to compliment your president for thetheme of this conference: generations coming together.   Asgovernor, I have worked hard to serve the retired people of mystate -- one of the states with the highest percentage of peopleover 65 in the United States. But, I want to be president torestore the promise of the American Dream for our children.  WhenI was a freshman at Georgetown University 28 years ago, I had aprofessor of Western Civilization who said that the very specialthing about our civilization in general, and the United States inparticular, is that we had always believed that the future could bebetter than the present, and that each of us has a personal, moralresponsibility to make it so.   That's what I want to talk abouttoday -- beyond the talk of Democrats and Republicans, beyondpointing the finger of blame to the assumption of responsibility.For the plain truth is that millions of our fellow citizens of allages do not believe the future will be better than the present, andmillions more do not believe they have a personal, moralresponsibility to make it so.  I learned the American Dream and Ilived the American Dream as a child growing up in Arkansas. Nearlyhalf a century ago, I was born in a little town called Hope.Somebody's here from there, probably. We're everywhere now. I havetwo delegates from Chicago who were born in Hope -- one fromQueens. We're way over our quota.  My father died in a car wreckthree months before I was born. My mother went back to nursingschool so that she could earn a living to support me. Until I wasfour, I was raised by loving grandparents of modest means but greatdetermination.  They taught me to read and count when I was two andthree. They   taught me in their own way that our country isn'tjust another place, it's an idea -- a solid covenant that spansgenerations, a commitment to uphold the values we learn in ourfamilies -- to honor our parents and grandparents, to offer ahelping hand to our sisters and brothers, to protect and providefor our children and our children's children.       I learned frommy grandparents the basic contract of American life that if youwork hard and play by the rules, you will be rewarded. That promisehas come true for me beyond my wildest dreams. But as I havetraveled across this great nation of ours, I've met too many good,hardworking people for whom that promise has been broken.   Comingover here today, I couldn't help remembering the encounter I had inNashua, New Hampshire with a couple named Mary Annie and EdwardDavis, who broke down crying telling me how every week they had tochose between their food and the medicine they needed to stay aliveand healthy. People like them have done right by America and nowit's time for America to do right by them.  One of the reasons Ientered this race for president is that I was tired of seeingpeople being punished for their devotion to work and family, tocountry, and community.  If any Americans have kept faith with theAmerican promise, it's the generation that worked their way out ofthe Great Depression, brought their way to victory over Nazism andFascism, led the way through the Cold War and sacrificed to providemy generation with opportunities our parents never had.  I'm goingto be a president who does right by older Americans because you'vedone right by America. And your country owes you that.  Doing rightmeans understanding that Social Security is a commitment that mustbe kept, not just for today's beneficiaries, but to today's workingpeople who are paying into the system for their tomorrows. It's acovenant -- Social Security -- a covenant between generations, andI will honor that.   Doing right means understanding, that in spiteof Medicare, most senior citizens still pay too much for healthcare. In fact, a recent study found that the average elderly personis actually paying a higher percentage of income for health caretoday than in 1965 -- just before Medicare was enacted in the firstplace.  During the first year of my administration, we'll send anational health plan to Congress to control the cost of health careby taking on the insurance and health care and governmentbureaucracies that add tens of billions of dollars in unnecessarycosts to our system. My plan will provide a comprehensive packageof benefits and have measures to discourage excessive cost andespecially to hold down the price of prescription drugs.  The planwill include long term care for the elderly and the disabled --charging people based on their ability to pay -- and will emphasizegreater choice in care, from home to nursing home service. Afteryou've worked hard all of your life you shouldn't be  wiped out byserious illness and you should have as much control over your ownlife as possible.  America is the only advanced nation in the worldwithout a national health plan. We spend 30% more of our income onhealth care than any of our major competitors, and we do less withit. And we lag  behind them as a result on many measures of healthcare from infant mortality, to heart disease, to life expectancy. We also, I might add, are dramatically underfunding women's healthresearch and development in areas from breast cancer to ovariancancer to osteoporosis and that's why the bill now in the Congressought to pass for new health investment.   As you know so well,Americans pay more for prescription drugs than the citizens ofnations who have national health plans. This is a special burden toelderly people who aren't poor enough to be on Medicaid but aren'trich enough to pay their bills themselves. Their numbers arelegion. Mary Annie and Edward Davis are but two of the hundreds ofthousands of them.  As the Senate Special Committee on Aging,chaired by my good friend and fellow Arkansan, David Pryor found,prices of prescription drugs during the last decade have risen bythree times the rate of inflation. And to add insult to injury,some American drug companies charge Americans more for the sameproducts here than they charge people in other countries. That'swrong and I want to change it.   That's why I support SenatorPryor's bill to take away tax breaks for drug companies to raisetheir prices more than the rate of inflation. When you go to thedoctor or the drug store or the hospital, your next stop shouldn'tbe the poor house.   These issues have long been a concern to me.Fifteen years ago, as one of America's youngest attorney generals,I created the Advocates for the Elderly Program to help olderpeople with their legal problems. As governor of my state I led thenation's governors in fighting to stop the unfair termination ofSocial Security disability benefits.   In Arkansas, we started along-term care program called Elder Choices, which let seniors usemoney normally reserved for nursing home care for long-term careservices of their own choice -- from personal care to home healthcare to adult day care.  The country I want to lead will honor itsobligations to people who've worked hard all their lives. But Ialso have to come here today to challenge you and all olderAmericans to honor our obligations to our nation's children becauseour future depends on their strength, their intelligence, theirskills, their    citizenship.  Thanks to Social Security andMedicare, our country has made progress in reducing poverty amongolder Americans. We can all be proud of the fact that, beginning in1985, for the first time in the history of America, the elderlywere less poor than the rest of America.   By contrast, poverty hasexploded among our children. Our new poor  in America are youngchildren and their mothers -- most of whom are working mothers --and we cannot be proud of that. We can't be proud that 13% ofAmerica's children have no health coverage whatever; that 30% ofall of our pre-schoolers are not immunized against mumps, measles,and rubella; that every year 40,000 babies born in the UnitedStates die before their first birthday. And many more are born withvery low birth weights, imposing great costs on society and bearingmental and physical limitations which may dog them throughout theirlives and further undermine their ability to be contributingcitizens.  We can't be proud of the fact that 20% of all childrenunder eighteen and 25% of all children under six are living underpoverty; that teenage boys are more likely to die from gunshotwounds than natural causes; that each year a half-a-millionAmerican children do not finish high school, and millions more stopthere with no further education, thus condemned to losing out inthe tough global competition in which what you earn depends on whatyou can learn.  It is astonishing to note that families under theage of 30 are earning more than 25% less than what theircounterparts were seventeen years ago. We cannot be proud of thisbecause today's children are tomorrow's workers, tomorrow's taxpayers, tomorrow's parents, tomorrow's citizens. If they grow upmalnourished, unhealthy, and unprepared to compete in the 21stcentury, then America will be neither safe nor solvent, neitherprosperous nor powerful.   We must not neglect our children and lettheir decline be the legacy of our generation. They are thenational security issue of 1992.  As all of you know, we know whatworks. We know what works in raising children -- how to help themgrow up healthy and hopeful, loving and learning, and ready tobuild their futures and libraries and laboratories instead ofgiving their lives away to gangs and guns on our meanest streets. Mr. Bush says when it comes to investing in America, we have morewill than wallet. What I say, now that we've won the Cold War,we've got to find the will to invest in our people, in our jobs, in our education, in our health care and reclaim our own legacy.   Wehave the wallet to spend over $100 billion on the savings and loanbailout in this year alone. We have the wallet to let health carecost go up two and three times the rate of inflation with the moneygoing straight to insurance and bureaucracy while our competitorshold them down. We have the wallet to keep protecting Germany fromthe Soviet threat, while German factory workers earn  20% more thanAmericans for a shorter work week, and the Germans invest in theformer Soviet Republics, while the former Soviet Republics slashtheir own defense budgets far more than we have cut ours.   And inthe 1980's, we had the wallet to cut taxes on the wealthiestAmericans and corporations, while raising taxes on the middleclass, slashing our investments in the future, and exploding thefederal deficit.  I know that the generation that won World War IIand the Cold War has the vision and the will and the discipline tojoin this crusade to invest in our young people and reinvigorateour economy. Your  generation has sweated and sacrificed and diedfor others. You've never had the attitude, "I've got mine, you getlost."  At the end of World War II, you led a strong America inrebuilding Europe and Japan. At the end of the Cold War, you mustlead us in rebuilding America -- in regaining our commitment to thefuture. You can teach all Americans lessons in patriotism, andcitizenship, and responsibility.  As president, I must challengeyou, and all Americans, to support a new national commitment toprovide every baby born in the United States with a healthy startin life from health care and nutrition for expectant mothers andtheir infants to immunization for young children.  I will challengeyou and all Americans to provide pre school for every child whoneeds it by finally fully funding Head Start so all our childrencan start school ready to learn. All this is in your self-interestand in our national interest. If we don't fully fund Head Starttoday, we may not be able to fully fund Social Security twentyyears from now.   As president, I must challenge you and allAmericans to help make every American school a model school becauseall our children deserve the best. I will challenge you and allAmericans to support a domestic GI Bill -- a domestic peace corpthat will offer college loans to every American of every agewilling to repay the loan or give a couple of years of service backto our community here at home -- not a peace corp for abroad, buta peace corp for America.    Think of it as we are here in SanAntonio. If every young person from San Antonio, or El Paso, orLaredo, or Houston, or Dallas, or Texarkana, or Lubbock, if everyone of them got a college education from a national service loanand came home to work as a police officer, a teacher, in a drugrehabilitation program, with kids in trouble, we could solve theproblems of America at home and educate a whole generation ofAmericans. It would be the best money we ever spent.   For thosewho do not want to go to college, we should follow our competitorsand give every high school graduate at least two years of furthereducation and training on the job with a national apprenticeshipprogram to restore the dignity of blue collar work in America.   Inorder to do this, we must have the discipline to control healthcare costs -- which is the single most important force in theexploding federal deficit today -- to reinvest all of our defensecosts in rebuilding the American economy, and to ask upper incomeAmericans to pay their fair share of taxes. Those who received mostof the benefits of the 1980's should shoulder more of the burden ofthe 1990's.  Let me be specific, although it may not be politicallypopular. If your income went up and your taxes went down in thelast twelve years, if family income is over $200,000, you shouldpay more. We cannot ask the middle class to pay more. Their incomeswent down and their taxes went up in the 1980's.   I support ahigher rate for the richest Americans and a sur-tax onmillionaires, such as that recommended in the recent tax billsponsored by Senator Lloyd Bentsen and vetoed by the president. Andif an older American on Medicare has an income in excess of$125,000 a year, I think there should be a higher price forMedicare if, in return, you get control of health care costs and asensible system of long-term care. No one should be forced to payfor the same old system and just take money out of private pocketand send it direct to health care companies or a bureaucracy thatis out of control.  We didn't get into this mess overnight, and wewon't get out of it without some sacrifice from those most able tomake it. The days of something for nothing for a few at the top areover. To make America work again, we need more incentives forprivate investment and new plant and equipment, to start newbusinesses, to invest in the most depressed areas of our cities andrural America. We also need more direct investment in education andin health care in our future.      Unless those whose incomes wentup while their taxes went down in the 80's pay their fair share, wesimply cannot afford to increase these investments and bring downour huge deficit. These are problems we must all face.         Ialso hope you will support other policies which reinforce thevalues of work and family. For all of those working poor familiesI talked about, how about a simple tax system that says we willincrease the earned income tax credit so that if you work fortyhours a week and you've got children in the house you will belifted above the poverty line.  How about a welfare reform systemthat says we'll invest more in your education and training andchild care and medical coverage, but you have to go to work. Wehave to end welfare as we know it.  How about providing morechoices for elderly people in long-term care and more choices amongpublic schools for parents and their children so there will be somecompetition but no private vouchers  to deplete the limitedresources of our public education system.  How about the toughestpossible system of child support enforcement so people can't bringkids into this world, cross the state line, and leave them for thegovernment to raise. That's the kind of thing we ought to besupporting.  How about a safe streets initiative that will bringpolice back to the blocks everyday, walking the same streets,working with the same neighbors, enlisting the energies of peopleto shut down the crack houses and open up the city parks. These arethe kind of programs we need in America today.  And so I say to theAARP, I respect the theme of this conference. I ask you to live it.I ask you to go home and ask your fellow Americans to reach acrossgenerational lines.  As I said at the beginning, I was raised by mygrandparents until I was four. I spent a lot of time with mygreat-grandparents who lived out in the country in what would becalled a shack today.  They were poor, but they were loving andstrong people. They made me feel loved and know discipline. Theygave me self-esteem and respect for others.  In the governor'soffice in Arkansas, I've got a picture of my grandmother in gradeschool in 1916, a picture a my grandfather at the furnace of asawmill in 1923, a picture of my great-grandfather holding my handin a hospital room in 1952.   It's a long way in America from thephotographs I have on my wall to our meanest streets where childrendon't know who their grandparents are, too often have to worryabout their parents' own    behavior and even drug abuse, and wheretoo many join gangs to find the extended family I knew naturally asa child.  America's future needs an investment of your time as wellas money. America's children need grandparents, even if they arenot their own. I want to lift the earnings limit on Social Securitybut I know our Social Security depends on your time being givenover to more than earnings. The elderly people of this countrycould revolutionize the lives of troubled children of Americathrough volunteer programs in schools and communities all acrossthis land. For America is a dream every child must cherish, apromise every generation must keep, a legacy we must leave to ourchildren and our grandchildren.  And so I challenge you not only tofight and strive and struggle to save social security, but also topreserve, protect and defend the security of our children; to fightnot only to keep medicare strong and stable but to make our economygrow and prosper; to work not only to keep older Americans out ofpoverty but to lift our children up as well.  Support programs thatreflect our shared values, putting the future ahead of the present,moving people from welfare to work,  establishing tough childsupport, lifting the working poor, creating a new system ofnational service for college education and more. Work, family,future -- that is what we must honor and reward.  Together we canend this era of every person for himself and begin the era of we'reall in this together. Together we can do for America, what Americadid for Europe and Japan at the end of World War II: build aprosperous and powerful new economy with millions of new jobs anddozens of new industries with people who are healthy and strong,and children who believe the future will be better than thepresent.  Most of all, we can leave our children a nation that isstronger, freer and richer than the one we inherited. That must, inthe end, be the true measure of our legacy as Americans: did weleave this world better than we found it? Today, the answer wouldbe no, tomorrow the answer can be yes. It is that question on whichthis coming election depends.  Thank you, and God bless you all.

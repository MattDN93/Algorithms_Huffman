                  THE TWO PARTY SYSTEM MYTH:                   Presidential Elections:                   The Multi-Partisan Truth                                               by Jackie Bradbury, Secretary                  Missouri Libertarian Party     People in the United States have been clinging to a mythfor a very long time now - that the United States is a twoparty system.  Heck, they use the term "bipartisan" as if itmeans that all views are represented, when in fact it is onlytwo opinions out of many.  We Libertarians know this isincorrect (and we have been using the term ourselves lately inColumbia, meaning Libertarians and Greens), but it's nice tohave it verified by outside sources.     The source I used is my old college days historytextbook:  _Essentials_Of_American_History_.  It lists all ofthe Presidential elections from 1789 (I added 1988 and 1992):it lists most of the candidates who got anything near asignificant vote total or an electoral vote.     See the chart below (Sysop note: adjoining file).  As youcan see, in fact a _three-way_ race is more common than anyother.  Three-way races make up 44% of all of our Presidentialelections, as a matter of fact (23 out of 52 total), and two-candidate races only make up 37% of all Presidential electionsin history...  We have even had a few four and five-way racesas well (19% of all elections).  And as an interesting note,look at how rare a two-way race is in the 20th Century ascompared to the previous one.  Perhaps we could speculate WHYthe cycle swings from multi-candidate elections to two-candidate elections.     It may have something to do with social upheaval -  youcan point to many of the multi-party swings and they tend tocorrespond with social movements such as women's suffrage, thecivil rights movement, etc.  They also somewhat correspond toeconomic stability as well, such as the current economiccrisis (our national debt) corresponds with the current multi-candidate swing in the cycle.  I'm sure a more competentpolitical scientist than I can figure out what happens andwhy:  the important thing is that, whatever the reasons, youcan see that indeed multi-candidate and multi-partisanpolitics are no strangers to democracy in the United States.(taken from the SHOW ME FREEDOM, June 1993 issue, apublication of the Missouri Libertarian Party).
